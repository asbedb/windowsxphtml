# windowsxphtml
A fun little excercise replicating the Windows XP splash screen with HTML, CSS and JS

I started this project fresh in August 2024 when I was first learning HTML and CSS.

With a little bit of refactoring i have published this version for now. Will need to go back and refactor some of the CSS to make it more lightweight however it is working as intended.

## Current Features
- Power On/Off
- Restart Function
- Scan Lines to replicate original LCD monitors
- Mobile Friendly (ish)

## Potentail Future Updates
- Sound
- Desktop UI
- More Easter Eggs
